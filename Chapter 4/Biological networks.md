Why do we need to study networks in biology? Cells are extremely complex units with a lot of components taking part in various functions, networks can help us simplify the connections and perform analysis on the connections between components.
All biological processes can be modeled as networks, since they occur thanks to interactions among molecules ([[Systems biology]]). For example proteins interact with each other or with other molecules generating and regulating several mechanisms (we will call them **protein networks**). Genes encode for proteins, so their interrelated activity determine protein abundance and related processes (we will call them **gene networks**).
There are various types of networks in biology:
- **Protein networks** describe the interactions between proteins, protein-protein interaction network is a mathematical representation of the physical contacts between proteins in the cell.
- **Gene regulatory networks** describe the interaction between molecular regulators within the cell, they represent the mechanisms between molecular regulators that interact with each other and with other substances in the cell (these regulators can be DNA, RNA or proteins).
- **[[Gene co-expression networks]]** describe the associations between variables that measure the abundance of transcripts, they represent the interconnectedness between genes. The nodes are the genes, the edges are similarity/ co-expression relationships between them.
- **Metabolic networks** describe the biochemical reactions in a living cell, they describe the relationship between small biomolecules and proteins or enzymes that produce biochemical reactions. Usually in these networks the nodes are the small biomolecules while the edges are the protein or enzymes.
- **Signaling networks** describe the signals between cells or within cells
- **Neuronal networks** describe the connections between neurons in the brain
## Biological complex networks
In general biological networks can be considered complex. We can perform analysis on it via statistical descriptive measures or biomolecular annotation analysis. 
We will now focus on statistical descriptive measures while we leave the other method for later chapters.
The majority of biological networks have scale free proprieties (see [[Network recap#Scale-free Networks]]) and can be modeled as such.
