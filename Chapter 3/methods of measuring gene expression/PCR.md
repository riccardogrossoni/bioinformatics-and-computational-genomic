PCR is a famous lab technique that exploits DNA replication to amplify a single of few couples of specific sequence of DNA by synthesizing billion of copies.
Is based on thermal cycles of heating and cooling of a solution where the replication reaction of the DNA occurs.

## RT-PCR
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction is a variation of standard PCR where first an RNA helix is "reverse transcribed" into its complementary DNA (called **cDNA**) by using the enzyme **Reverse Transcriptase**. Then the cDNA is amplified through standard PCR or real-time PCR.
