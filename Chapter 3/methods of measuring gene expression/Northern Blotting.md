It's a laboratory technique specialized in studying genetic expression by finding RNA or isolated mRNA ([[RNA types#^mRNA]])
Here's a brief introduction to the steps:
1) Isolate RNA from the biological sample
2) Denature the RNA and separate it based on its size using *gel electrophoresis*
3) Fix the RNA to a membrane (usually nylon or nitrocellulose)
4) Prepare a labeled RNA/DNA probe complementary to the RNA sequence and incubate the membrane with the probe allowing it to hybridize to the target RNA
5) Remove unbound probe via washing
6) Visualize the probe that is bound on the membrane using autoradiography or image equipment (depends on the type of probe used)
7) Analyze the results to determine presence, size and abundance of specific RNA molecules
