Each gene codes for a pool of biological info. We call **Genetic expression** the conversion of coded information in a gene, which, for coding genes, is the transformation in mRNA ([[RNA types#^mRNA]]) and after that into proteins. Not each gene is necessary to the cell's life, but we call the ones that are **Constitutive genes**. These genes are always expressed, while the others are expressed only when necessary. 
Gene's expression is regulated by necessity, these necessities depend on the ambient conditions and the functions needed to be performed.
In a multi cellular organism the "environment conditions" are basically the organism itself. Starting from the same cell, based on the organism conditions, The differential gene regulation will make it so that different genes are expressed causing the creation of different specialized cells.
The genetic information is the same in every **somatic cell** of an organism, but the genetic expression, ergo the protein synthesis, is different depending on the cell type and the answer to the environment.
for each cell, the expressed [[Transcriptome]] is about 20% of the total set.
But knowing the [[Genome]] and the genes is not sufficient to understand how everything work, it's also necessary to study: 
- genetic expression and regulation;
- synthetized protein functionality;
- quantitative occurrences of metabolites;
- effects of gene defects on organism [[Phenotype]];
This means also introducing [[Systems biology]].
There are already methods that perform functional analysis of genomes:
- Transcriptomics
- Proteomics
- Metabolomics
These methods all require use of high throughput procedures that require data managing and analysis. All these methods must be complemented with other analysis, such as phenotypic analysis.

## Analysis techniques
How do we measure gene expression?
The first method is to measure the expression level **one gene** at a time using **RT-PCR (Reverse Trascriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, see [[PCR#RT-PCR]])**. But there are methods to analyze the whole transcriptome, such as:
- **cDNA microarray** ([[Microarrays#cDNA microarrays]])
- **Oligonucleotide microarray** ([[Microarrays#Oligonucleotide microarrays]])
- **SAGE** (will not be covered)
There are also additional methods that work "some genes" at a time:
- **[[Northern Blotting]]**
- **Quantitative PCR**
And methods for the whole genome:
- **[[Molecular Biology]] techniques**
- **Micro/nano technologies**
