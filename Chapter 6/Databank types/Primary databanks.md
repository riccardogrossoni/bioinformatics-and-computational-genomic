Are databanks of [[nucleic acids]] and amino acid  sequences. They are called primary databanks because they contain *only* generic information. More in specific they contain the minimal information to be associated with the sequence in order to identify it from the point of view of specie-function.

Each sequence introduced in a databank with its annotation constitutes an “entry” and is identified by an ID or accession number.
## Famous primary databanks
For DNA databanks, the main ones are:
- EMBL at EBI (European Molecular Biology Laboratory)
- GenBank
- DDBJ
For amino acids and [[proteins]] the main ones are:
- UniProt
- Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL
- PIR
## INSDC
The International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration is a project supported by the 3 major primary databanks to promote:
- The **Taxonomy Project**: one of its main goals is using a unified taxonomy in all three databanks;
- The **Feature Table**: identifying a set of information to associate to each sequence and the mechanism of data exchange;
