This type of databanks collect sets of homogeneous data from the taxonomic and or functional point of view. These data, available in the primary databanks and/or in the literature, are revised and annotated with added value information. These databanks can be human curated, computationally derived or a combination of the two.
## Definition
A simple subset of the primary databank data, homogeneous from the biological point of view, accurately revised and enhanced with specific biological information inherent to the considered subset.
## Types
- **Genomic databanks**: representative of the whole set of info derived from mapping and sequencing projects of the human genome and of other genomes selected as model organisms;
- **Integrative databanks**: created to collect information dispersedly stored in other specialized databanks;
-
