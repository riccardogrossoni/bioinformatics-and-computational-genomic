Today, Biomolecular data is produced in never before seen quantities, in multiple types (genetic sequences, protein microarrays, pictures, annotations etc, more on [[Biomolecular data types]]]).
Biomolecular data and information are stored in databanks that are (mostly) public and internet accessible. In the aggregation list of *Nucleic Acids Research* there are (as of 2022) 1645 databanks available.
These databanks can be divided into:
- [[Primary databanks]]
- Derivative or [[Specialized databanks]]
A full discussion on how selected databanks work and should be operated is available in [[Databanks_tutorials.pdf]]. Note that you should read the [[README_chapter6]] before reading the tutorial.
