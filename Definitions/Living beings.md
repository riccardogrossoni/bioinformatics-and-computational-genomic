Have 7 common traits that differs them from inorganic matter
## Complexity in structure
Organisms have complex structures at each level (macroscopic, cellular and intracellular level).
## Organization
Organisms structures are highly ordered and functional, both at macroscopic and microscopic level.
## Use of energy
Organisms can get energy from the environment to build and maintain their structure.
## Reproduction
Organisms can reproduce themselves by generating new living beings that unalterably continue basilar characteristics of the specie.
## Development
In superior organisms one cell can differentiate into many cells that characterize each type of tissue.
## Reaction to stimuli
Living beings react to external and environmental stimuli to get the maximum advantage with the minimum expense of energy.
## Evolution
Living beings can evolve, meaning they can transform themselves through changes in time.
