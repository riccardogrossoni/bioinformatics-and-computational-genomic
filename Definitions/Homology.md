[[Similarity]] between characters due to descent from a common ancestor. 

## Other types
Homology can also be considered with proteins and DNA sequences. In bioinformatics homology between proteins and DNA is often concluded on the bases of sequence similarity.

## Differentiation
homolog sequences can be divided into 2 groups
- **Orthologs**: genes that share the same ancestral gene and perform the same function but in different species.
- **Paralogs**: genes within the same [[genome]] that share an ancestral gene and perform diverse biological functions.
