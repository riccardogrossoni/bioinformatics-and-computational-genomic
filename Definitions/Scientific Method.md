Careful observation of a phenomenon of reality that suggests to the scientist a question to be answered.
## Study of literature
Before starting a research a careful study and analysis of papers regarding the topic must be done.
## Formulation of the hypothesis
Depending on literature and personal observation an hypothesis is formulated.
## Conduct of experiments
To verify the hypothesis the researcher carry out experiments that simulates, in a simplified form and controlled conditions, the phenomena. These experiments must be **reproducible**.
## Formulation of law
If the hypothesis is validated by the data then it's assumed as law, otherwise a new hypothesis is needed.
