As explained in [[Chapter 5 - Bio-terminologies and bio-ontologies]], ontologies and terminologies are fragmented and there are a lot of models with difficulty of translation between each of them.
The **Unified Modeling Language System** is an effort to overcome two of the main problems:
- The variety of ways with which the same concepts are expressed by different models.
- The distribution of useful information among many separate databases and systems.
The main problem to unifying is that each dictionary goes into different levels of details and connections, making the transition harder.

This is what UMLS conceptually wants to achieve. 
To be able to achieve it we need 3 main things:
- Lexical knowledge
- Semantic pre-processing
- Editors 
Now the UMLS has 3 main grades:
- Specialist Lexicon: 360k lexical terms with part of speech and variant info
- Metathesaurus: 6M names from over 100 terminologies with 1.5M concepts and 8M relations
- Semantic Network: 135 high level categories with 7k relations among them
The terminologies databases come from different sources including MeSH
