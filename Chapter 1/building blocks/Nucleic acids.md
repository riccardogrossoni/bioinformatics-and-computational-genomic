They are the most big molecules in cells, constituted by long sequences of monomers known as **[[Nucleotides]]**.
The sugar used by the nucleotides determines the type of acid:
- **Ribonucleic acids (RNA)** are constituted by nucleotides with ribose sugar
- **Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** is instead constituted by nucleotides with deoxyribose sugar
## DNA
It contains all the genetic information necessary for the life of the host organism. it's organized in structures called [[Chromosomes]]. In [[Prokaryote cells]]  there is only 1 chromosome, while in [[Eukaryote cells]] there are more then 1, for example humans have 23.
Depending on the type of cell it can have multiple copies of the Chromosome set, they are called **Haploid** if there's only 1 set, **Diploid** if there're 2 sets, **Triploid** if 3 etc. Most cells are diploid.
DNA is formed by long chains of [[Nucleotides]], linked by the bond between the phosphoric acid and the sugar of the next nucleotide. This bond is also called **3'-5' phosphodiester bond**. In normal conditions it assumes the form of a double helix, where there are 2 chains of nucleotides that "go" in opposite directions, kept together by hydrogen bonds.
## RNA
Differs from the DNA due to the ribose as sugar instead of the deoxyribose, has the nitrogenous base U instead of T and always exists as single chain (but the bases interact in 3-D shapes that are not fully understood yet). RNA has a vital role in the synthesis of proteins and in living beings without DNA is used during the reproduction process.
There are various types of RNA, each with a different role. Find more here: [[RNA types]]
