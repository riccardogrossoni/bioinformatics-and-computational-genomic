Are polymers constituted by chains of amino acids (called monomers). 
## Amino acids 
Are molecules constituted by a central Carbon atom connected with:
- 1 atom of Hydrogen
- 1 amino group (-NH_2)
- 1 carboxylate group (-COOH)
- 1 side-chain (R) that varies for each amino acid
There are 20 amino acids. The molecule have 2 extremities, one ending with the carboxylate group called **C-terminus**, the other ending with the amine group called **N-terminus**. 

## Peptides
The N and C extremities of the amino acids can bond together, forming a **Peptide bond** which is linear and rigid. The molecule that is formed is called **Peptide**. This molecule can then bond with additional amino acids, forming a family of molecules known as **Polypeptides**. All polypeptides have 1 "free" N-terminus extremity and 1 "free" C-terminus extremity.

## Protein structure
A protein is essentially a chain of polypeptide molecules. A polypeptide can contain from 3 to hundreds amino acids. The 3-D structure of the protein is determined by the torsion of the bond, but not all angles are possible, there are only a few depending on the amino acid.
We can divide the protein structure into 4 levels:
- **Primary structure**: is determined by the amino acids sequence that forms the protein;
- **Secondary structure**: the local 3D conformation, with regular and repetitive bonding of polypeptide chains in well defined and fixed geometric structures (spiral, aka alpha-helix, plane, aka beta-strand or beta-sheet, loops, which is a combination of the previous two).
- **Tertiary structure**: 3D arrangement of the secondary structure elements, is mainly influenced by hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and Van der Vaal forces. The assumed structure is the one with lower free energy. This sector is the one determining the proprieties and functions.
- **Quaternary structure**: Is the spatial organization of multi-subunit complexes (one subunit is multiple polypeptides with a defined tertiary structure).
The structure of the protein, if stable and constant "folding structure" determines her domain. A Domain has a stable 3D structure and it folds independently of the environment. The domain is often only part of the protein, and many proteins have more than one domain. 
The primary structure highly determines the tertiary one, in fact from the sequence of amino acids we can now "predict" the tertiary structure (not with 100% accuracy though).
**Denatured proteins** are proteins that have "lost" their tertiary structure, while still maintaining the primary one. A denatured protein cannot execute it's function unless the tertiary form is restored. 
Two proteins are called **isoform** if they differ for little details, sometimes due to alternative splicing or polymorphisms.

## Functions
The proteins can perform different functions inside a living being: structural, enzymatic (catalyze the majority of cellular reactions), hormonal (execute regulative functions and transmit signal within the organism), immunity (defense from other organisms, mediated by immunoglobulins).
The function of the protein depends on proprieties of the protein itself, which are determined by the amino acids that the protein contains but mainly on the 3-D structure of the protein.
