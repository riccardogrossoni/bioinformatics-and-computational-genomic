The genetic material of an organism, DNA, RNA and proteins.
## Genome types
- **Viruses' genome**: Since viruses are the simplest life form their genome is also the simplest. Viruses are not independent cells, since they are parasite they rely on external cells to reproduce. Their genome is composed by 1 molecule of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA depending on the type) which is encapsulated in a protein shell (with different shapes) called **Capsid**. 
	- **Bacteriophages**: have a Icosahedral head capsid, which contains genetic material and is connected to a tail with spikes, that allows the virus to stick to the bacterial cell wall. While hanged genetic material is injected inside the bacteria where it reproduces itself.
	- **Viruses of [[eukaryote cells]]**: Both for plants and for animals, the capsid is either icosahedral or filamentous, can be either DNA or RNA based and assumes a more structured form, either double helix, single helix, linear or circular. Most viruses can integrate their genome in the host cell, determining changes (often deadly) in the life of the infected cells. This process is called **Cellular transformation**.
	- **Retroviruses**: It contains 1 or 2 molecules of RNA in the genome. Thanks to the enzyme Reverse transcriptase, the RNA is converted into a single chain DNA, then in double helix by DNA polymerase. In this form the genome can be integrated in the host cell's genome and reproduce itself.
- **Bacterial genome**: Since all bacteria are [[Prokaryote cells]] they do not have a defined nucleus, but the genome is contained into a compact structure called **nucleoid** with a single molecule of DNA (usually in circular form) inside. Bacterial DNA has between 2000 and 2500 genes in a continuous sequence. In addition to this some bacteria have smaller DNA structures called **plasmids**, which grant some benefits to the cell. Firstly it can integrate and detach from the nucleoid DNA, granting a variable genetic mix to the cell, but also it has different types, including R plasmid which grants resistance to antibiotics, Degradation plasmids which allow the bacteria to metabolize chemical compounds and fertility factors. 
- **eukaryote cells genome**: The nucleus is a lot more complex wrt eukaryote cells. There are different linear molecules of DNA contained insides [[Chromosomes]]. Not all of the genetic material resides inside the nucleus, a small fraction of circular DNA can be found in some cellular organelles, for example **chloroplasts** (in vegetal cells) and **mitochondria**.

## Duplication of genetic material
To guarantee the transmission of genetic information to the offspring before cellular duplication the DNA is copied (the process is called **DNA duplication/replication**). The process is the same in both eukaryote and prokaryote cells and follows a semi conservative process: each daughter molecule has 1 strand of DNA of the mother and 1 of new synthesis.
The duplication starts with the opening of the double helix, then from the two single helixes in parallel are created two new strands. the point in which the DNA double helix opens is called **Replication fork**. The concurrent duplication does not occur along all the DNA molecule at once but just in a specific position at a time. 

## Gene structure
Genes are structured in **codons**, which is a triplet of bases. Some specific combination of bases determines the **Start codon** and the **Stop codon**. In prokaryote cells the gene is continuous, while in eukaryote cells the gene has "useless" sections inside called **introns**, while the coding nucleotide sequences are called **exons**. The coding area is around 3% of the total genome, while more than 50% is constituted by repeating sequences (which further split into **tandem repeats** and **interspersed repeats**). 

## Gene expression
With gene expression we classify the process that trasfers genetic information from DNA to RNA to proteins. This transfer is one-directional. Firstly during **transcription** DNA information leads the synthesis of RNA in the 5' to 3' direction. This process requires only 1 helix of DNA, called **mold helix**. This synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme **RNA polymerase** (this enzyme is different in prokaryote and eukaryote cells). In eukaryote the transcription is a complex process, for example there are 3 types of RNA polymerase and each identifies a different gene set. Each polymerase also requires other proteins, called **transcription factors** that lead the specific RNA polymerase linkage. The synthesis of RNA is continuous, meaning that there can't be a "skipped" section of the DNA, so in eukaryotes both introns and exons are fully transcribed. This produces a primary transcription called **pre-RNA**. Another complex process called **splicing** removes introns sequences from **pre-RNA**, producing **mature-RNA**. This mature-RNA is then translated in proteins.
Due to splicing, **more than one transcript** can be obtained from the same gene. There are 4 types of alternative splicing:
- **cassette exons**: full exons transcribed only in some cases
- **Isoforms of introns/exons**: there can be clipping and extensions in the boundaries between introns and exons
- **introns retention**: introns are included in the final transcript
- **mutually exclusive exons**: different exons can be included in different final transcripts.

## Genetic code
Just a brief recap on genetic code:
- Is almost universal (the same for most of the cells)
- has 64 "letters" (4 bases that can be arranged in a codon, 4^3 combinations)
- each letter has a amino acid translation or is a start or end codon
- "AUG" is a start codon, "UAA/UAG/UGA" are the stop codons.
