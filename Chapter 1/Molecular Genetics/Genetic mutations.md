During DNA duplication (see [[Genome#Duplication of genetic material]]) it's possible to have a variation in the sequence of nucleotides bases called a **mutation**. This mutation can then be transferred to the offspring which will become a **mutant**.
The mutation can be lethal for a single individual, so all organisms have various mechanisms to fix the possible damage to DNA. First of all the low % of codifying DNA decrease the probability of mutation of a codifying area, which can potentially be lethal. The non lethal mutations are transmitted to the offspring and when the affected population is >0.01% it's called a **polymorphism**. 
Some genes are highly polymorphic.
In general, [[Genome]] of an individual is **unique**. Even though the majority of mutations are inherited, in some points of the DNA the number of repeats of a tandem repetition is highly variable.
## Single nucleotide polymorphism
SNP is the variation of a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence of an individual. When affecting a codifying region it can impact biological functionality, since it can encode a different amino acid. SNPs can be good **biological markers**, but due to the very high number of possible snp's it requires a huge number of cases for a statistically significant observation. 
Many common pathologies are not caused by SNPs, but by complex interactions between genes, environment and lifestyles. (**gene predisposition and non genetic factors**).

## Types of mutations
There are mainly 3 types of mutation:
- **Genetic mutation**: alteration to the gene structure, including Single Nucleotide polymorphism;
- **Chromosomal**: alteration in the one of the [[chromosomes]] structure;
- **Genomic**: alternation in the number of chromosomes;
genetic mutations can then be expanded into further categories:
- **Substitution**: a base is substituted with another in the nucleotide sequence
- **Insertion**: a base is inserted in a nucleotide sequence
- **Deletion**: a base is deleted in a nucleotide sequence
- **Invertion**: a (short) nucleotide sequence, usually due to excision of a stretch of the double helix and a following reinsertion in the opposite direction, is inverted sequence wise.
Mutations can be effective or not on the [[Phenotype]]. 
- a mutation is **neutral or silent** if it brings a new codon that codifies the same amino acid
- a mutation is **missense** if it brings a new triplet codifying a different amino acid
The different amino acid can have effects on the phenotype, and if the amino acid role is important to life it can lead to a **lethal mutation**. Some mutation can have a benefic effect on the cell, for example a new antibiotic resistance for a bacteria.

Chromosomal mutations change the structure of a chromosome compared to his normal karyotype. This mutations are easily detected with a microscope. there are 4 typical mutations:
- **Deletion**: a stretch of a chromosome is lost. In homozygotes this can be often lethal and it usually have phenotypical effects. In heterozygotes it can be partially balanced by a normal homolog chromosome. 
- **Duplication**: doubling of a stretch of chromosome. is generally less harmful wrt deletion.
- **Inversion**: change in order of two or more genes in a chromosome. 
- **Translocation**: alteration caused by the detachment of a stretch with a further attachment to a different chromosome.

Finally, genomic mutation concern the total number of chromosomes in each cell of the individual.
- **Polyploidy (euploidy)**: the number of chromosomes is a multiple of the haploid arrangement. This is common for plants but very dangerous for animals.
- **Aneuploidy**: loss or addition of 1 or few chromosomes. It leads to strong alterations of phenotypes in animals, while is common in plants. One example is the down syndrome.

## Mutagens
The frequency of a mutation can be increased when the organism is exposed to substances called **mutagens**. there are various types of mutagens, including radiations.
- **physical mutagens**: radiations of different wave length. Can range from heat (breaks bonds between A/G base and sugar), high energy radiations (e.g. **ionizing radiations**) and **Ultraviolet radiations**
- **Chemical mutagens**: some chemicals can substitute nucleotide bases, for example iprite. Some other chemicals can react with DNA bases and alter them, this category is the most numerous. 
- **Environmental mutagenesis**: presence in the ambient of many mutagenic substances capable of inducing tumors.
## Fixing DNA damages
There are various mechanisms to fix DNA damage, here a list:
- **Photoreactivation of dimers T-T**: With an enzyme called **DNA photolyase** that is present in all cells, the T-T bond is cut if activated by light.
- **Repair towards damage's excision**: a complex process involving numerous enzymes, that will detect damage, cut the DNA before and after the damage, remove the damaged stretch (**excision**), polymerization of missing stretch and welding of the extremities.
