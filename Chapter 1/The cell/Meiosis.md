Through sexual reproduction the new cell originates from the union (fecundation) of:
- one **female** sexual cell called "egg cell" or **ovum**.
- one **male** sexual cell called **spermatozoon**.

Sexual cells are haploid, meaning that they contain only 1 set of Chromosomes. The process of Meiosis generates 4 haploid cells form the duplication and then 2 subsequent nucleus divisions starting from 1 haploid cell.
