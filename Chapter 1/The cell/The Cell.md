Is the biological unit of all living beings.
Each organism can be **Unicellular** or **Multi-cellular**.
The cells can be divided into two main categories:
- [[Prokaryote cells]]
- [[Eukaryote cells]]
## Building blocks of the cell
The cell is composed by different building blocks, the main are:
- [[Proteins]]
- [[Lipids]]
- [[Polysaccharides]]
- [[Nucleic acids]]
Cells can reproduce through a phenomena called **cellular division**. This process is regulated by the cell's genetic information and the frequency varies depending on the type of cell. 
## Cellular reproduction
While Prokaryote cells reproduce via binary fission There are 2 main types of reproduction for eukaryote cells: **Asexually** and **Sexually**.
- Asexual reproduction consists in a process called [[Mitosis]].
- Sexual reproduction is vastly more complex and consists in a process called [[Meiosis]] and a fecundation.
