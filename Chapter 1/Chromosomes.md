Chromosome are the structures that contain genes in a cell. Humans have 23 chromosomes. Chromosomes are constituted by **chromatin**, which is roughly made by equal parts of DNA and proteins, with a small part of RNA. Chromatin has a structure with spherical particles called **nucleosomes**, with DNA "rolled" around them. There are other proteins molecules that are more strictly connected to the DNA called **Histones**.
Chromosomes assume the famous X shape during a phase of cellular division called **metaphase**. the arms are called **Chromatids**, while the central part is called **Centromere**. at the extremities of the chromatids there's the **telomeres** (basically the 4 tips of the chromosome).
The structure of the chromosome in the X shape can clinically identify it, that's called **kariotype**. 
By **artificially staining** the chromosome areas rich in A and T bases will appear darker, generating a sort of bands pattern that can be used to make a **nomenclature**.
Chromosomes also express the sex of the individual, in [[Eukaryote cells]] sex is genetically determined by a pair of non homolog chromosomes. 
## Sexual chromosomes
In humans and many other organisms, there are 2 different chromosomes, called X and Y that take part in the determination of sex.
if the chromosomes are both X (XX), then the individual has female sex, if the chromosomes are XY then the individual is male.

For reproduction purposes the ovum has 1 X chromosome, while the spermatozoa are half X half Y, meaning that there's roughly 50% probability that an individual is male and 5% that is female.

The genes associated with sex are located on the chromosomes X and Y, but there are also other traits not located on the sexual chromosomes that are affected or limited by sex.

## Example of nomenclature reading
6p21.3:
- 6 indicate the number of the chromosome (chromosome 6)
- p indicates the shortest arm of the chromosome
- 2 the group of bands (also called region) visible on the arm starting from the centromere
- 1 the band inside the group, counting from the centromere to the telomere
- 3 indicates the sub-band, a thin band visible inside the darker and thicker one, also while starting counting from the centromere
That means, position 6p21.3, which indicates third sub-band in the first visible band on the second group localized on the short arm of chromosome 6.
