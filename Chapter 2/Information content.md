Given a matrix of weights (profile) that models a sequence alignment, we can determine the information content I(k) for each alignment position k as: $$I(k)=log_2(m)-(H(k)+e(n))$$Where m is the number of characters in the alphabet of the aligned sequences, H is the [[Shannon Entropy]], e(n) is the correction factor (that depends on n=number of sequences in the alignment modeled by the weight matrix)
